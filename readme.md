# ðŸ§  PatternForge

Welcome to **PatternForge** â€” a fictional tech company where I (Oladapo) explore and share real-world implementations of software design patterns through simulated scenarios from legacy codebases, client projects, and new system builds.

This is my creative and educational journey to solidify my understanding of design patterns while helping others learn as well.
